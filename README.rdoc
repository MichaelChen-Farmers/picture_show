== Picture Show

I made this in an hour and a half, high on peppermint schnapps.

Post to /images/create with the form field "image=YOUR_IMAGE_IN_MULTI_PART"

Then go to the home page.  It will show your most recent image, updating every 30 seconds.  So cool!

=== Installing

You need imageMagick for this.  That's about it!
